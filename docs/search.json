Example: gender (male, female), marital\r\nstatus (single, married), race (Malay, Indian, Chinese), grade (A, B,\r\nC)\r\nQuantitative variable – when the variable studied comes in term\r\nof numbers (numerical value) Example: number of student, total income,\r\ndistance traveled, test mark etc.\r\nQuantitative variable can further be classified as:\r\nDiscrete – assume only exact values\r\nExample: no. of student, annual sales, total income, shoe size,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nContinuous – can be expressed in a certain degree of accuracy\r\nExample: Distance traveled litters of petrol, weight and height of\r\nchildren, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\nConsider a population of 120,000 students in Terengganu. It was found\r\nthat the mean height of the student is 148 cm and the variance is 1.5 cm\r\n. It also found that the mean height of 1,500 students in Dungun High\r\nSchool is 152 cm and the variance is 2 cm.\r\n\r\nPopulation – 120, 000 students in Terengganu\r\nSample – 1,500 students in Dungun High School\r\nElement – student\r\nVariable – height of students\r\n\r\nParameter vs Statistic\r\n\r\nParameter is a numerical measure used to describe a population.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistic is a numerical measure used to describe a sample.\r\n\r\nBelow are some examples of parameter and statistic based on the\r\ninformation in the previous example.\r\nParameter:\r\nStatistics:\r\ni. Population Size, N = 120,000\r\ni. Sample Size, n = 1,500\r\nii. Mean, \\(\\mu\\) = 148 cm\r\nii. Mean, \\(\\bar{x}\\) = 152 cm\r\niii. Variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\) = 1.5\r\ncm\r\niii. Variance, \\(s^2\\) = 2 cm\r\nData and Measurement\r\nData is a collection of observations, measurements or information\r\nobtained from study that is carried out.\r\nSources of data:\r\n\r\nPrimary data – data that is gathered and published for the first\r\ntime by the researcher.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. satisfy the research objectives\r\ni. very costly\r\nii. more up to date\r\nii. time consuming\r\n\r\niii. sensitive data is difficult to\r\ncollect directly from the respondent\r\n\r\nSecondary data – data that is obtained from other sources (not the\r\nresearcher) such as from annual report, journal, newspaper, internet\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. easy to obtain\r\ni. data might not satisfy the research\r\nobjective\r\nii. less costly\r\nii. there might be errors committed by the\r\noriginal researchers.\r\niii. can obtained in a large quantity\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurement is simply the act of determining the quantity of values\r\nof a variable or assigning number to a variable.\r\n\r\nLevel of measurement:\r\nNominal – qualitative as well as categorical\r\nExample: gender (1= Male, 2= Female)\r\n\r\nOrdinal – categorical as well as essence of order (arranged\r\nin a certain order)\r\nExample: level of education (1=Primary, 2=Secondary, 3=University,\r\n4=Post-graduate)\r\n\r\nInterval – categorical, has order that can describe ‘how\r\nmuch more or how much less’ of a characteristic and has the existence of\r\nan ‘arbitrary zero point’.\r\nExample: level of satisfaction, temperature\r\n\r\nRatio – consist of all the characteristics discussed above\r\nplus another characteristics of ‘absolute (true) zero point’\r\nExample: height of students\r\n\r\nExercise 1:\r\nDetermine for the following whether you would use descriptive\r\nstatistics or inferential statistics for the following information.\r\nA trainer wanted to determine the minimum time taken by his swimmers\r\nto swim 100m.\r\nAn economist uses a bar chart to illustrate the loss made by an\r\nairline company from 1990 - 2000.\r\nA few botanists do a research on the relation between durian\r\nproduction and the usage of cow manure as fertilizer.\r\nPsychologists study whether urban students are higher achievers as\r\ncompared to suburban students.\r\nDewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur formed a committee to investigate the\r\nrelation of flash floods occurrence and the amount of rubbish in Sungai\r\nGombak and Sungai Kelang.\r\n\r\nDetermine which of the following term is constant or variable. If it\r\nis a variable, determine whether it is quantitative or qualitative. If\r\nit is qualitative, determine whether it is discrete or continuous.\r\nNumber of days in February.\r\nMarks to get grade B.\r\nMaximum marks to get grade B.\r\nMarital status of the workers in a firm.\r\nThe length of 2000 screws in a production line\r\n\r\nSampling and Census\r\n\r\nCensus - To study the whole population\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Data collected from all elements.\r\ni. Very costly and time consuming.\r\nii. Data are more complete.\r\nii. Result would be out to date.\r\n\r\nSampling - To study the sample. Sampling is the process of selecting\r\na sample from a population.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Less costly and required less\r\ntime.\r\ni. Data not collected from all\r\nelements.\r\nii. Result is more up to date.\r\nii. Data are less complete.\r\nSampling Techniques\r\nRandom Sampling\r\n(Probability Sampling)\r\n\r\nEvery elements in the population has equal chance to be selected as\r\nsample.\r\n\r\na. Simple Random Sampling\r\n(SRS)\r\n\r\nSampling frame must be available.\r\n\r\nTwo methods can be used to randomly select n elements, where n is the\r\nsample size:\r\nLucky draw method\r\nRandom numbers\r\nExample 2:\r\nA group of researcher planned to survey the family backgrounds of all\r\nstudents studying in UiTM. Due to time constraint, they decided to\r\nsurvey only 300 students. By using simple random sampling, discuss how\r\nthey would select the sample.\r\nMake a list of all the students who studying in UiTM. Assign each\r\nstudent a unique number, between 1 until the last students.\r\nUsing lucky draw:\r\nWrite the numbers on a small slip of paper and deposit all the slips in\r\na box. The first selection is made by drawing a slip out of the box\r\nwithout looking at it. This process is repeated until the sample size of\r\n300 is chosen.\r\nUsing random numbers:\r\nRefer to a table of random numbers. Starting at any point in the\r\ntable read across or down and notes every number that falls between that\r\nnumbers. Use the numbers you have found to pull the names from the list\r\nthat correspond to the 300 numbers you found. These 300 students are\r\nyour sample. OR\r\nUse random number generated by the computer software in order to\r\nselect the sample. The person correspond to the numbers produced by the\r\ncomputer will be the sample.\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Every element has equal chance to be\r\nselected.\r\ni. Not suitable for heterogeneous\r\npopulation.\r\nb. Systematic Random\r\nSampling (SYRS)\r\n\r\nSampling frame must be available. How to collect sample?\r\n\r\nStep\r\nIdentify the population size (N), and sample size (n).\r\nObtained the range k by dividing the population size by the sample\r\nsize.\r\nSampling Interval, \\(k\\ =\\\r\n\\frac{N}{n}\\)\r\nRandomly select one element from the first \\(k\\) elements in the list (using SRS).\r\nSuppose the \\(r_{th}\\) th element is\r\nselected.\r\nLastly sample every \\(k_{th}\\)\r\nelement in the population begins with the \\(r\\) element until a sample of size n\r\nobtained. i.e., \\(r_{th},\\ (r+k)_{th},\\\r\n(r+2k)_{th},\\ ...,\\ (r+(n-1)k)_{th}\\)\r\nExample 3:\r\nThere are 200 elements in the population and a sample of 10 is desired.\r\nDiscuss how the sample can be selected by using Systematic Random\r\nSampling.\r\n\\(N=200,\\ n=10.\\)\r\nSampling Interval, \\(k\\ =\\ \\frac{200}{10}\\\r\n=\\ 20\\)\r\nRandomly select a number between 1 and 20. By using SRS, let say we\r\nselect number 2.\r\nThen the sample shall consist of elements,\\[\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\n     &2, 2+20, 2+2(20), 2+3(20), ......................., 2+9(20) \\\\\r\n     &2,  22,  42,  62,  82,  102,  122,  142,  162,  182. \\\\\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n\\]\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Every element has equal chance to be\r\nselected.\r\ni. More difficult to use.\r\n\r\nii. In order to get a good sample,\r\npopulation must be properly arranged.\r\nc. Stratified Random\r\nSampling\r\n\r\nApplicable for population that is categorized such as according to\r\nsex, races, etc.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of the population:\r\nElements in each stratum are homogeneous\r\nElements between the strata are heterogeneous\r\nExample 4:\r\nA group of research planned to survey all workers working in an\r\nindustrial area. They are divided as followed. In order to save cost,\r\nthey are decided to survey only 600 of the workers. Discuss how the\r\nsample can be selected by using stratified random sampling.\r\nRace\r\nSub Population Size\r\nNumber of Sample\r\nMalay\r\n2800\r\n\\(n_1\\ =\\\r\n\\frac{2800}{4500}\\ *\\ 600\\ =\\ 373\\)\r\nChinese\r\n1250\r\n\\(n_1\\ =\\\r\n\\frac{1250}{4500}\\ *\\ 600\\ =\\ 167\\)\r\nIndian\r\n450\r\n\\(n_1\\ =\\\r\n\\frac{450}{4500}\\ *\\ 600\\ =\\ 60\\)\r\nTotal\r\n4500\r\n600\r\nTo sample each of the stratums, use either simple random sampling or\r\nsystematic random sampling.\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Every element has equal chance to be\r\nselected.\r\ni. More difficult to use.\r\nii.Suitable for categorized\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nd. Cluster Sampling\r\n\r\nApplicable for a population that is divided into homogeneous or\r\nsimilar cluster. Elements in the cluster are heterogeneous.\r\n\r\nHow to use cluster sampling?\r\nA population is divided into clusters (using naturally occurring\r\ngeographic or other boundaries)\r\nThen clusters are randomly selected.\r\nA sample is collected by taking all elements in the selected\r\nclusters.\r\nExample 5:\r\nA group of researchers planned to survey all family in Kuala Besut,\r\nliving in 50 villages. In order to save cost, they decide to survey only\r\n10 villages. Discuss by using cluster sampling.\r\nSuppose you divide district Kuala Besut into 50 villages. Then by\r\nusing simple random sampling or systematic random sampling, select 10\r\nvillages from 50 villages. Sampled each (all) of the elements in 10\r\nvillages.\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Suitable for a population that is quite\r\nlarge.\r\ni. Difficult to ensure that cluster are\r\nsimilar/homogeneous\r\nii. Suitable for clustered\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\ne. Multi-Stage Sampling\r\n\r\nSuitable for a large population. Selection done by stages.\r\n\r\nExample 6:\r\nA group of researchers planned to survey the background of all form 5\r\nstudents in Terengganu. They decided to use sampling. Discuss.\r\nLet say:\r\nThey randomly selected\r\nFive districts from 11 districts in Terengganu.\r\n6 schools from each selected district.\r\n25 students from each selected school.\r\nNon-random\r\nSampling (Non-probability Sampling)\r\n\r\nNot all elements in the population has equal chance to be selected as\r\nsample.\r\n\r\na. Quota Sampling\r\n\r\nSuitable to be used if sampling frame not available and in market\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nExample 7:\r\nA group of researcher planned to survey 120 house-owners in Dungun who\r\nhave been using Sharp washing machines for more than 2 years.\r\nDiscuss.\r\nThe numbers allocated for each group of respondents is based on the population statistics. The researcher has the flexibility to choose whomever he wants as long as the specifications set are met.\r\nb. Convenience Sampling\r\n\r\nThe researcher has the flexibility to select anybody that they wants\r\nor meets until the required sampled is obtained\r\n\r\nc. Judgmental Sampling\r\n\r\nThe researcher selects a respondent whom he thinks has a certain\r\ncharacteristics that he wants to study\r\n\r\nd. Snowball Sampling\r\n\r\nAn initial group of respondent is selected usually at random. After\r\nbeing interviewed, these respondents are asked to identify others who\r\nbelong to the target population of interest.\r\n\r\nData Collection Method\r\nGenerally there are 6 methods of data collection that can be used in\r\norder to collect the primary data. They are:\r\ni. Personal interview\r\n\r\nResearcher talks to the respondent face to face.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Produce the highest response rate.\r\ni. Very costly and time consuming.\r\nii. Can explain any unclear questions\r\nii. Interviewers must be properly\r\ntrained.\r\nii. Telephone interview\r\n\r\nInterviewer asks questions from a prepared questionnaire\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Less costly and required less\r\ntime.\r\ni. Appropriate only for population with\r\ntelephones.\r\nii. Can contact respondents several\r\ntimes.\r\nii. Respondents might refuse to\r\ncooperate.\r\niii. Mailing\r\n\r\nA questionnaire is sent to each respondent with a stamped addressed\r\nenvelope attached.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Less costly.\r\ni. Response rate very low.\r\nii. Can be used in any population\r\nsize.\r\nii. Unsure when the questionnaires shall\r\ncome back.\r\niv. Direct observation\r\n\r\nRespondents will be observed without their knowledge\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\nDisadvantages\r\ni. Data obtained very accurate.\r\ni. Very costly and time consuming.\r\nii. The access of information is not\r\naffected by the respondents.\r\nii. The observer needs to be highly\r\nskilled and unbiased\r\nv. Direct Questionnaire\r\n\r\nThe researcher gives the questionnaire directly to the respondent and\r\nwaits for them to complete it.\r\n\r\nvi. Other methods\r\n\r\nElectronic e-mail, internet survey and short messaging services\r\n(SMS).\r\n\r\nDesigning A Questionnaire\r\nBefore you begin drafting your questionnaire, it is important to\r\nconsider:\r\nWho is the questionnaire for?\r\nWhat is it intending to find out or measure?\r\nSome guidelines in designing a questionnaire\r\nDesign questions to meet the objective of the research.\r\nQuestions must be short and clear.\r\nLimit the number of questions.\r\nUse language understood by any layman.\r\nDoubled – Barreled Questions should be avoided. E.g. Do you think\r\nthere is a good market for the product and that it will sell well? Could\r\nbring a “yes” response to the first part and a “no” response to the\r\nlatter part.\r\nAmbiguous Questions should be avoided. E.g. “To what extent would\r\nyou say you are happy? Respondents might be unsure whether the question\r\nrefers to their state of feelings at the workplace, or at home, or in\r\ngeneral.\r\nAvoid questions that might require respondents to recall experiences\r\nfrom the past, they may be unable to give correct answers and may be way\r\noff in his responses.\r\nLeading questions should be avoided. E.g. Don’t you think that in\r\nthese days of escalating costs of living, employees should be given good\r\npay raises? By asking such a question, we are signalling and pressuring\r\nrespondents to say “yes”. Another way of asking to elicit less biased\r\nresponses would be: “To what extent do you agree that employees should\r\nbe given higher pay raises?\r\nExercise 2:\r\nA researcher wishes to study the career aspirations of students\r\nfrom the Faculty of Accountancy, which consists of 50 classes. The\r\nresearcher intends to choose only 10 classes and all the students from\r\nthese 10 classes will be chosen for the study.\r\nState the population for the above study\r\nState the variable for this study. What type of variable is\r\nit?\r\nState the sampling technique that is used for this study.\r\n\r\nA group of researchers from Yayasan ABC conducted a survey on\r\ntheir sponsored students who are currently pursuing their studies at\r\nlocal universities. The purpose of the study is to determine the average\r\nmonthly amount spent on academic books by these students. A list of 350\r\nstudents’ names arranged alphabetically and addresses was obtained. A\r\nrandom sample of 70 students was selected from the list.\r\nState the population of the study.\r\nState the variable mentioned in the study.\r\nSuggest an appropriate sampling technique to be used.\r\nExplain how the sampling technique chosen in (iii) is carried\r\nout.\r\nWhat is the most suitable data collection method to be used for the\r\nabove study? Give one advantage and one disadvantage of this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Find the mode\r\n8 9 9 14 8 8 10 7 6 9 7 8 10 14 11 8 14 11\r\nSolution:\r\nArrange the data in ascending order.\r\n6 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 10 10 11 11 14 14 14\r\ntherefore, the mode is 8.\r\nMeasure of position\r\nDownload\r\nSlides - Measures of Position\r\nBox-and-whisker plot provides a useful graphical representation of\r\nthe data.\r\nQuartiles\r\nThe quartiles are descriptive measures that split the ordered data\r\ninto four quarters with three dividers.\r\n\r\nFirst quartile (Q1)\r\nSecond quartile (Q2)\r\nThird quartile(Q3)\r\n\r\nRules for obtaining the quartile values\r\nIf the positioning point is an integer, the numerical observation on\r\nthe positioning point is chosen for the quartiles.\r\nIf the point is halfway between two integers, the average of their\r\ncorresponding observations is selected.\r\nIf the positioning point is neither an integer nor a value halfway\r\nbetween two integer, proportionate between the two integers.\r\nExample 7\r\nThe three-year annual returns of 14 low-risk funds arranged in\r\nascending order are given as follows.\r\n\r\n9.77 11.35 12.46 13.80 15.47 17.48 18.37 18.47 18.61 20.72 21.49 22.47\r\n31.50 38.16\r\n\r\nFind the first and third quartiles.\r\nSolution\r\nPosition of first quartile, \\(Q_1\\)\r\n\\[\r\n\\begin{align}\r\nQ_1\\ position&= \\frac{n+1}{4} \\\\\r\n&= \\frac{14+1}{4} \\\\\r\n&= 3.75 \\\\\r\n\\\\\r\nx_3 &= 12.46\\ and\\ \\\\\r\nx_4 &= 13.80 \\\\\r\nQ_1 &= 12.46 + 0.75(13.80-12.46) \\\\\r\n&= 13.465\r\n\\end{align}\r\n\\]\r\nPosition of third quartile, \\(Q_3\\)\r\n\\[\r\n\\begin{align}\r\nQ_3\\ position&= 3(\\frac{n+1}{4}) \\\\\r\n&= 3(\\frac{14+1}{4}) \\\\\r\n&= 11.25 \\\\\r\n\\\\\r\nx_{11} &= 21.49\\ and\\ \\\\\r\nx_{12} &= 22.47 \\\\\r\nQ_1 &= 21.49 + 0.25(22.47-21.49) \\\\\r\n&= 21.735\r\n\\end{align}\r\n\\]\r\nGROUPED DATA\r\nMEAN\r\nFor grouped data, each class interval is represented by the mid-point\r\nof the interval, X_i.\r\nExample 8\r\nThe table shows the years of working experience for 120 employees of\r\nJimmy’s Company.\r\nSolution:\r\nMEDIAN\r\nFor grouped data, median is calculated as follows.\r\nwhere \\(n\\) = sample size,\\(L_m\\) = lower limit of the median\r\nclass,\\(f_{m-1}\\) = cumulative frequency\r\nbefore the median class\\(f_m\\) = frequency of the median class\r\nand\\(c\\) = median class size\r\nExample 9\r\nUsing the data in example 8, compute the median\r\nSolution:\r\nStep 1: Obtain the cumulative frequencies\r\nStep 2: Identify the class that contains the median and obtain the\r\nmedian location.\r\nStep 3: Apply the formula\r\nMODE\r\nThe mode can be estimated by using histogram.\r\nStep 1: A histogram is drawn for the data and the class with the\r\nhighest frequency (modal class) is identify.\r\nStep 2: Two lines are drawn at the top of the column, one from the top\r\nright-hand corner to the top right-hand corner of the class before the\r\nmodal class, and another from the top left-hand corner to the top\r\nleft-hand corner of the column after the modal class.\r\nStep 3: At the point of intersection, a vertical line is drawn towards\r\nthe horizontal axis of the histogram.\r\nStep 4: The variable value is the mode of the distribution.\r\nMode can also be calculated using the formula.\r\nwhere\r\nL = lower boundary of the class containing mode.\r\nc = size of the class containing mode\r\nf0 = frequency of the class containing mode\r\nf1 = frequency of the class before the class containing mode\r\nf2 = frequency of the class after the class containing mode\r\nExample 10\r\nUsing the data in example 8, compute the mode.\r\nSolution:\r\nThe modal class is 9 – 12 since the frequency of the class is the\r\nhighest.\r\nSkewness\r\nMeasure the lack of symmetry in a data distribution The relationship\r\nbetween mean, median and mode Measure of position The position of\r\ngrouped data can be measured by the first and the third quartile denoted\r\nas Q_1_ and Q_3_ respectively.\r\nMethod 1\r\nThe first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles\r\nStep 1: Obtain the cumulative frequencies\r\nStep 2: Identify the first and third quartile classes.\r\nStep 3: Find the first and third quartile\r\n    First quartile, Where  \r\n    L1 = lower limit of the first quartile class  \r\n    n = number of observations\r\n    fm-1 = cumulative frequency before the first quartile class  \r\n    f1 = frequency of the first quartile class  \r\n    C1 = first quartile class size  \r\n    \r\n    Third quartile, where  \r\n    L3 = lower limit of the first quartile class  \r\n    n = number of observations  \r\n    fm-1 = cumulative frequency before the third quartile class  \r\n    f3 = frequency of the first quartile class  \r\n    C3 = third quartile class size  \r\nExample 11\r\nTable below shows the distribution of test scores obtained by 42\r\nstudents in a Statistics class. Calculate Q1 and Q3\r\nStep 1:\r\nStep 2: Identify the location or position of the first and third\r\nquartiles\r\nStep 3: The value of Q1 and Q3 are as follows\r\nMethod 2 Using Ogive (cumulative frequency curve)\r\nStep 1: Mark off the first and third quartile location on the\r\ny-axis.\r\nStep 2: From each of the quartile location marked on the y-axis, draw\r\ncrosses the x-axis is the estimated quartile value.\r\nExercise The speed of 120 cars that drove through a specific sharp\r\ncorner on a federal road is given in the table below. Find mean, median\r\nand mode speed.\r\nMeasures of Dispersion\r\nDownload\r\nSlides - Measures of Dispersion\r\nMeasures of dispersion give us a value that can be used to describe a\r\nset of data as a whole. Just knowing the measures of central tendency\r\nvalue of a data set is not enough for us to describe the distribution of\r\nthat data. The centralized measure does not provide information on\r\nwhether the data is widely distributed or otherwise.\r\nThe measure of dispersion is based on the mean value. If the observed\r\nvalues are close to the mean of the distribution then the dispersion of\r\nthe data is small and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
